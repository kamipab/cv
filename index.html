          <h3>Development Skills</h3>
          <p>
            My Developer path started in January of 2021. I tried a few Mobile
            App's whit basics problems of HTML and CSS and I really loved it. I
            realized how much of possibilities is in developer career. Than in
            August of 2021 I started a 9 month Courses of Back-End development.
            Most of the Lessons were intended for JAVA, Spring and MySql. And
            just in the very begining I had some Lessons related with Front-End
            technologies. But after those Courses I realized, that I am more
            interested in Front-End development, so here I am. Starting My
            amazing Journey as Front-End Developer with a little Pinch of
            Back-End.

          <h3>Other Skills</h3>
          <p>
            I also have some others Skills which are not directly related with
            development, but I think is essentials for Developer. I am very good
            in communication with people. It is really easy for me to get into a
            new Squd and make a new Friends. I also have a good Skills in a
            managing of intensive or critical Situations. I do not have a
            Problem work under Time pressure, because I aquired a excellent
            Abilities to manage My Time. And the last but not a less important,
            is My desire to learn a new Things. My moto is: "If you able, learn
            a one new Thing every Day".

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          As a lot of People I love to travel. I think that Travels is the best
          way to spend our Money, because it enrich our Souls and broadened
          Horizons. Also I love to read. Because I think is the second best way
          after traveling, to gain new Experiences and World outlook. The last
          one oh my current hobbies is a programming. It is a amazing Way to
          spread Your imagination and adapts all your knowledge. And it is
          wonderful continious process of learning.
